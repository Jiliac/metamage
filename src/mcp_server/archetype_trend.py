    """
    Get weekly presence and winrate trends for an archetype over time.

    Args:
        format_id: Format UUID (e.g., '402d2a82-3ba6-4369-badf-a51f3eff4375' for Modern)
        archetype_name: Name of archetype (case-insensitive)
        days_back: Number of days to look back (default: 30)

    Returns:
        Dict with weekly trend data: dates, entries, matches, winrates

    Workflow Integration:
    - Use with get_meta_report() to correlate an archetypeâ€™s trend with overall meta shifts.
    - Combine with get_format_meta_changes() to annotate trend inflection points (bans/set releases).
    - Drill down into specific time windows with get_archetype_winrate() or query_database().

    Related Tools:
    - get_meta_report(), get_archetype_winrate(), get_format_meta_changes(), query_database()

    Example:
    - Find a dip in presence, then use get_sources() for that week range to collect tournament links,
      and query_database() for card-level or matchup-level explanations.
